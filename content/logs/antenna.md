I'm a semi-active participant in the #gemini IRC channel on Tilde.chat, and today I noticed that [ew0k](gemini://warmedal.se/~bjorn/) had announced [Antenna](gemini://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/announcing-antenna.gmi). The idea of Antenna is to avoid polling of Atom feeds, where back-offs and downtimes can be detrimental to services trying to combine feeds from several sites. Instead, sites push their updates to the service, much like ping-backs of the old blogging days. Updates to Antenna are then focused on receiving these pings and updating their data, rather than the constant battle of polling and scraping.

As of this post, I've added a call into my site build script. Hopefully, this service will present a more active view of the Gemspace community and allow some sites that have slipped through the nets of CAPCOM to get noticed.
