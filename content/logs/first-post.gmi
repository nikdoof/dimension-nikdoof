I've been meaning for a while to create a gemblog, or capsule, however you want to call it. I got tied up with process and spent far too much time trying to convert my existing Hugo website (nikdoof.com) to a Gemini site, as it turns out its a extremely difficult problem to solve and not one that can be done in a quick weekend. So with that I decided to just create a small, rambling log here, different from my main site's content.
